### This Is my first actual mod, so some feedback would be appreciated

##### As this is my first mod, I'm not 100% sure if I've done everything the most efficient way possible, but I did my best

# Enchantments and multiplayer

I haven't tested any modded enchantments (yet), but the vanilla ones work correctly

From what I've tested, it works fine on multiplayer

But admittedly, I play basically just singleplayer, so if there are multiplayer only issues, I'll mostly likely never find them on my on

The mod needs to be installed on the server and is heavily recommended on the client

If you find anything wrong, please do [report it](https://github.com/PrincessCyanMarine/Simple-Veinminer/issues)

# Config

The mod works out of the box, but it has some config options you may find useful

I suggest messing around with them a bit to find what fits you best

~~The easiest way to do that is by using [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config), but both are optional~~ (Temporarily unavailable)

# Commands
The config options can also be changed using /veinmining or /veinminingclient

# Highlighting
There are config options to highlight what blocks will be mined

When using the "outline" mode, I recommend turning on "highlight only exposed". As the outline of non-exposed blocks can't be seen anyway

Beware of the "highlight only exposed" option, as turning it off can lag your game when highlighting a large number of blocks depending on how powerful your computer is (Having "max blocks" set too high would lag (or even crash) your game when mining anyway. So be careful with that)

If you are confused about the difference between highlighting modes, I recommend testing them on anvils

# ~~Shapes (BETA)~~ Removed
